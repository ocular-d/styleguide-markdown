# Whitespace

::: tip Key Point
:bulb: Guide about whitespaces.
:::

## Indentation character

Always use spaces where two (2) spaces are used for indentation.

**The usage of tab characters is disallowed**.

A tab could be a different number of columns depending on the environment, but a space is always one column.

Adhering to this rule increases the code readability and maintainability significantly.

**:thumbsup: Correct** code for this rule:

```markdown
Plone is fun!
  This line contains 2 space characters.
```

**:thumbsdown: Incorrect** code for this rule:

::: tip Note
The `»` character represents a tab.
:::

```markdown
Plone is fun!
 » This line contains a tab character.
```

```markdown
Plone is fun!
    This line contains 4 space characters.
```

```markdown
Plone is fun!
 This line contains only 1 space character.
```

## Before blocks

Always add one (1) blank line before blocks except the first line of the file.

## Maximum line length

In contrast to source code, where lines contain statements that can be almost always be broken up or indented,
this rule can not be applied to flowing text.

The author should be able to write sentences and text blocks without worrying about the line length.

This guide advices to **avoid using a character limit per line for flowing text**,
but try to use a maximum line length of 120 characters (including whitespaces) for all other document elements.

<!--lint disable-->

Instead of enforcing a maximum line length, users should use [soft line wrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap "Link to Wikipedia"):

- **Soft wrapping allows line lengths to visually adjust automatically with adjustments to the width of the user's window** or margin settings.
- **Using hard wrap inserts actual line breaks in the text at wrap points causing the Markdown to not look like the rendered output** - With soft wrapping the actual text is still on the same line but will be rendered by the application like it's divided into several lines.
This **increases the readability** significantly and leads to the same visual result as if a maximum line length with hard line breaks for flowing text would have been used.
- **Less writer effort** - The author can focus on the content instead of formatting.

Volto is great!

```markdown

You can use it for small and huge sites! It is the base
for many beautiful sites.
```

## Trailing

Do not use trailing whitespace to generate a line break, use flowing text style or a blank line to create a new paragraph.
