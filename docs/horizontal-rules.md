# Horizontal Rules

::: tip When to use
:bulb: Horizontal rules can be used to separate sections when headers are not applicable or
to separate base document elements like a header, body and footer.
:::

## Marker character style

A horizontal rule must consist of three (3) hyphens (`-`) without spaces.
