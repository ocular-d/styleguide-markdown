:bulb: How to add hidden, non-rendered comments.

<!-- vale off -->
## HTML
<!-- vale on -->
Prefer [HTML comment syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/syntax.html#sec-comments "Link to w3-html5-spec about comments") to add hidden,
non-rendered comments.

**:thumbsup: Correct** code for this rule:

```markdown
<!-- This is a comment only visible in the code and not in the rendered output -->
```
