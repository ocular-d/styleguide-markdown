## No header replacement

Do not use emphasis elements (bold or italics) to introduce a multi line named section.
Use headers instead which is exactly the semantic meaning of headers.

As a consequence, many implementations add useful behaviors to headers and not to emphasis elements, such as automatic ID generation (anchor)
to make it effortless to refer to the header later on.

Use a level 6 header if the meaning of the header section should not stand out great.

Do not use inner spaces for any markers.
